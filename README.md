# Technical description and resources consulted
This site is a prototype intended primarily for demonstration purposes. The visualization project itself was an exploratory venture and would require optimization to function with larger datasets. On a technical level, the page structure is designed to be visually simple, and for the basic HTML and CSS structures and styling (the two panels, the dropdown explanations, and the popups that appear for certain lines), I relied on knowledge that I have gained from tutorials like those found at [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

The JavaScript which handles the interactive features of the website was relatively new to me when I started this project, and much of what I have currently put together was derived through experimentation. The full [JavaScript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) at W3 Schools was a particularly helpful starting point.  

The JavaScript loads the images along with corresponding XML as a list of constants, whose paths are hard-coded into the script. The XML files are parsed using a [DOM parser](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dom.asp), which retrieves the coordinates (the location of the text on the image) as well as its identifier (line 1, 2, 3, etc). In the process, I ended up simplifying the structure of the XMLs, eliminating the transcriptions and replacing them with line identifiers; but future iterations of the project will maintain the original structure of the XMLs in order to preserve this information for future visualization features. The pixel coordinates are then used to draw SVGs that appear as translucent polygons on top of the images.  

The main logic behind the mechanism that highlights specific passages relies on a function that [listens](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp) for specific user actions such as hovering or clicking ([mouseenter](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html) / [mouseleave](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html) or [clicks](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20Events.html)).  
All of these user actions cause all the polygons that share the same identifier to change color, and the click action locks them until something else is clicked. Specific lines are additionally flagged to trigger a popup that explains details about the passage.  

Finally, the scrolling function—which was included primarily to dramatize the often non-linear and selective way that this reader engages with the text—automatically moves images in the left pane to bring the matched passages into view. This functions by first locating the image and position of the polygon containing the text, calculating how to center it in the panel, and using a method ([scrollTo](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_scrollto.asp)) to scroll the document to that location.
